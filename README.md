# Day 1 :-  Introduction to Verilog RTL design and synthesis
#### 1.	Introduction to open source simulator iverilog

Simulator is a tool which is used for checking the RTL design. RTL design is basically a implementation of specifications so by simulating a design we can check whether design meets the required specification or not. In this course we have used tool called iverilog for simulating RTL design. Simulator works in such a way that it looks for the changes on the input signals and based upon that the output is evaluated. If no change to the input, no change to the output.
Testbench is the setup to apply test vectors to the design to check its functionality.
Block diagram of iverilog based simulation flow.
Design and testbench applied to the simulator and simulator checks for the changes in input and accordingly the output is evaluated and the output file is called as value change dump format file (VCD file). To view VCD file gtkwave tool is used to check the waveform.

### Introduction to Yosys and logic synthesis

Yosys is the synthesizer tool used for converting RTL to netlist. Netlist is the representation of design in the form of standard cells present in .lib. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5754c11e-9bf2-48b7-b080-d98cac6478ba)

This synthesis can be verified by applying synthesized netlist and testbench to the iverilog and output vcd file which can be viewed in gtkwave should be  same as output observed during RTL simulation.

# Day 2 : Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles
Lab Introduction to timing.libs

Lets first understand the lib name. Here lib name is sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80  where 
- tt stands for typical
- 025C stands for temperature
- 1v80 stands for voltage of 1.8v
Libraries are characterized based on Process Voltage Temperature.
Process : Variation due to Fabrication
Voltage : Variation due to voltage
Temperature : Variation due to Temperature.
.lib contains information about :
- technology here technology used is cmos, delay model, units of time(ns),voltage(V),power(nW),current(mA),resistance(Kohm),capacitance(pf) ,
- Operating conditions (PVT) ,
- Information about all the standard cells and its leakage power,area,pin related information such as input capacitance,power and delay associated with that pin,
- timing information of cell such input transition and output load.

Observation : As the size of cell increases delay decreases, power and area increases.


Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis :

Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis :-
RTL code of multiple_modules.v

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c2eb924-119e-4b4e-af4e-76aac6962314)

Submodule 1 has AND gate and submodule 2 has or gate. This is an example of hierarchical synthesis.
Before synthesis logic is :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5427c4d2-3254-41ae-bf28-9ed1c24f2097)

In hierarchical synthesis both the modules are synthesized separately.
Logic after synthesis :-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e447c625-f04d-4462-9cf6-ea96326ca8c3)


After synthesis,tool rather than applying inputs a and b directly to or gate, a and b are passed through inverter and then NAND gate. Tool chooses NAND implementation because in CMOS stacking PMOS in OR gate is bad as PMOS has poor mobility and to improve this we have to make sure the cell is wider in order to get appropriate output.

Flat synthesis 
In flat synthesis, both the modules are instantiated under the top module.

Submodule Level Synthesis 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b96b49c-30c8-4c88-a0c5-32da31f1527c)

Here synthesis is done at submodule1 level

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dca2f07-8106-49cb-93e3-a59cf0d2a2dd)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3b3942-d1be-4436-b1fc-02995e009769)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66fc9384-dda6-44a1-9810-bf6816441e84)

Why submodule level synthesis is needed?
For example, consider a design called multiplier and multiplier is instantiated for a multiple times. So instead of synthesizing multiplier for multiple times we instead synthesize multiplier for one time and replicating it for multiple times and then stitched that netlist to the top level to save time.
Module Level Synthesis is preferred when : 
- we have multiple instances of same module.
- Divide and conquer : When the design is very massive in that case we divide the design into small portion then give it to tool so that we can get appropriate netlist and then stitched that netlist to the top level.
To synthesize the submodule Independently command used is : -
synth -top module_name

Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimization
Why do we need flipflops?
In digital circuits, glitches refers to the unnecessary signal transitions in a combinational circuit and it can occur due to the different propagation delays of the signals in the combinational circuits so to avoid glitch flipflops are used in such a way that it will give stable output at the specific clock edge  eventhough flipflop input is glitchy.
flipflops are used in between the combinational circuits so flipflop acts as a synchronizer. To control the initial state of flipflop reset/set signals are used and this control signals can be synchronous or asynchronous.

Flipflop coding styles

DFF with Asynchronous posedge reset : DFF output is irrespective of clock so Whenever the reset signal is high DFF output will become zero.

DFF with Asynchronous posedge set : DFF output is irrespective of clock. Whenever the set signal is high DFF output will become 1.

Posedge DFF with synchronous  posedge reset : DFF output Is with respect to positive clock edge. output will become zero only at the positive clock edge and when reset is high.

Synthesis of Mul_2 :-
RTL code

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63756a5b-25ba-4642-aafc-0ef078bb34e3)

The above RTL code accepts 3 bit input (a) and it is generating a 4 bit y. and y is equal to 2 * a.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b80bda3a-5f7f-4597-9593-1849d1732f96)

Truth table :-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d2e7312-4ac8-42d9-a387-4884cf1be068)

From truth table you can observe that 1st 3 bits of output y is exactly same as 3 bit input a, only the last bit of output y is appended with zero. 
So the number multiplied with 2 (i.e a * 2)  = the number a appended with 1â€™b0

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/759fd56b-59cf-43c7-8d28-670ad8797e5f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4e4ae62-8f35-4a99-a220-27f185ad816d)

In netlist also you can observe that y is a appended with 1 bâ€™0.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/378b251a-1493-4169-80f7-40e0bda59320)

Since the number of cells present for mapping are zero so need to perform abc mapping.

# Day 3 : Combinational and Sequential optimization

Introduction to Combinational Logic Optimization :-
It means Squeezing the logic to get the most optimised design in terms of Area and Power.
Techniques used to perform combinational logic optimization are :
- 1.	Constant Propagation : It is a Direct optimization technique.
- 2.	Boolean Logic Optimization : It is used to simplify big Boolean logic expression using techniques like K-map, Quine McKluskey

Example of Constant Logic Optimization : The propagation of a constant can generate a more optimize logic.
Previously, Y = ((AB) +C)â€™ --ïƒ  6 transistors required 
 but when A = 0, Y = Câ€™ ---ïƒ  2 transistors required.

Boolean Logic Optimization 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ee3a78f-e0a9-4bb4-843d-01bd9f7ff12b)

Sequential Logic Optimization 
Techniques of Sequential Logic Optimization are :-
- 1.	Basic
    - Sequential Constant Propagation


- 2.	Advanced [Not Covered as part of Lab]
    - State Optimisation
    - Retiming
    - Sequential Logic Cloning (Floorplan Aware Synthesis)

Example of Sequential constant Propagation :-
When RST is enable Q = 0 ,
When RST is disable Q = 0 since input D = 0.
So output Q is always 0 irrespective of RST signal.
And When constant sequential constant is propagated to NAND gate,output of NAND gate (Y) will always be 1.
Example 1 :-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b54a8f-5034-46d0-acfa-a444d7fa4025)

Example 2 :- When Set is enable 1, Q=1 and When Set is disable so with respect to clock Q = 0. Q pin is not taking constant value. It can take value either 0 or 1 Because of this sequential constant is not propagated at the output of flipflop. This flop cannot be optimized so this needs to be retain the circuit.

After synthesis , Y = a.b
